# ⚙️ Energy Optimization Agent

The Energy Optimization Agent is a cutting-edge tool designed to help chemical plant managers optimize energy consumption, enhance production efficiency, and improve maintenance schedules. By leveraging real-time and simulated data, this agent analyzes the interdependencies between energy usage, production rates, and equipment maintenance, providing actionable insights for improved operational performance. It simplifies complex data into clear, professional reports that guide decision-making and lead to sustainable energy practices.  

Using the Crew AI framework, this system comprises of five specialized agents, where each plays a unique role to streamline report generation. The system also integrates a GPT-based model to contextualize complex findings, enhance simulation scenarios, and generate professional, human-readable reports tailored to plant managers' needs. This collaborative approach allows for dynamic, data-driven decision-making and a comprehensive view of operational optimization.  

One of the generated reports is available as a Markdown (.md) file for easy viewing. The complete system workflow, along with two additional generated reports, is documented in the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file. All code cell outputs are included to ensure transparency and verify that the system functions exactly as described.  


# Working of the System
In a real-world scenario, the system receives a CSV file where the latest row represents the most recent data. New results are continuously appended to the file, allowing the system to process the latest information while retaining past history for reference.
